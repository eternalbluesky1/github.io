            <div class="page">
                <h1>(1) The Introduction</h1>
                <p>Adrift in a sea of days that blurred into one another, the question echoed in the quiet moments: "What happened to me?" The path I had so carefully mapped seemed to vanish beneath my feet. Each morning brought not a sunrise, but a grey haze of uncertainty. The world kept spinning, but I felt stuck, a silent observer to a life I no longer recognized as my own. There was a profound sense of disconnect, as if watching a film about a stranger.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page">
                <h1>(2) The Diagnosis</h1>
                <p>Then came the words that fractured my reality. A clinical term, delivered with professional calm, shattered my world into a million pieces. The sound in the room faded to a dull roar, a static hum that drowned out everything else. In the ensuing shock, I clung to the familiar walls of VGU, a fortress of routine in a suddenly hostile world. It was my only anchor, a desperate attempt to pretend that nothing had changed, even as the ground had irrevocably shifted beneath me.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="page">
                <h1>(3) The Failure</h1>
                <p>The walls of my fortress began to crumble. The academic pressures at VGU, once a welcome challenge, now felt like insurmountable peaks. Every assignment was a reminder of my cognitive fog, every deadline a new source of anxiety. This was my low point. The path I had clung to for safety became the very stage of my unraveling. It felt like a profound, personal failure, a confirmation of the fear that I was no longer capable, no longer myself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="page">
                <h1>(4) The Pivot</h1>
                <p>But in that darkness, a flicker. A tiny, defiant spark of "no." No, this would not be the end of my story. It wasn't a grand revelation, but a stubborn refusal to be defined by my circumstances. The weight of failure was immense, but the thought of surrendering was heavier still. It was a conscious choice to turn my face towards a different light, even if I couldn't yet see its source. This was not giving up; it was pivoting. It was the start of a fight.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="page">
                <h1>(5) The New Direction</h1>
                <p>That spark led me somewhere unexpected. The name "RMIT" appeared, first as a whisper, then as a tangible possibility. It represented not a replacement for my old path, but an entirely new map. Exploring this new direction felt like breathing fresh air after being underwater. A new sense of purpose began to take root, one that wasn't about reclaiming what was lost, but about building something new and uniquely my own. The future, once a source of dread, now held a hint of promise.</p>
            </div>
             <div class="page">
                <h1>(6) The Resolve</h1>
                <p>Looking back, I see the threads connecting every moment. The confusion, the shock, the failure—they were not just obstacles, but crucibles. The skills I have today were forged in those fires. My ability to adapt, my empathy, my sheer tenacity—these are not just items on a resume; they are proof of my resilience. I no longer see a story of what was lost. I see the story of a person who was tested, who bent but did not break, and who learned to build a stronger foundation from the rubble.</p>
