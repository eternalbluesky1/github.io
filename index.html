            <h1>(1) Intro</h1>
            <p>
                This is the story of my clumsy journey. As you noted in your ideation, this is where the prologue goes. I wanted to create something that wasn't just a list of skills, but a narrative that shows my growth and how I got here.
            </p>
            <p>
                This first page sets the scene, capturing the feeling of opening an old diary, ready to draw some lessons from the past.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="page right-page">
            <h1>(2) What Happened to Me?</h1>
            <p>
                Here, I can dive into specifics. I can talk about the "failed choices/diagnosis" and the "experience on" that shaped my path. Each paragraph is like a journal entry, a moment of reflection.
            </p>
            <p>
                This section isn't about listing jobs; it's about the story behind the resume points. It is the beginning of the realization that I needed to move to a new environment.
